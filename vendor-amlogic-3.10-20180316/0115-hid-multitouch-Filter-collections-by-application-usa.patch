Subject: [PATCH 0115/5965] hid-multitouch: Filter collections by application
 usage.

This change fixes two problems.

First, it ensures that the hid-multitouch driver does not incorrectly
map GenericDesktop usages that are intended for other applications,
such as a Mouse.

Second, it sets the appropriate input properties so that user-space
can distinguish TouchScreen devices (INPUT_PROP_DIRECT) from
TouchPad devices (INPUT_PROP_POINTER) and configure them accordingly.
