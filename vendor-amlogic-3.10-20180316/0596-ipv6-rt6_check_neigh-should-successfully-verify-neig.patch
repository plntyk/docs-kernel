Subject: [PATCH 0596/5965] ipv6: rt6_check_neigh should successfully verify
 neigh if no NUD information are available

[ Upstream commit 3630d40067a21d4dfbadc6002bb469ce26ac5d52 ]

After the removal of rt->n we do not create a neighbour entry at route
insertion time (rt6_bind_neighbour is gone). As long as no neighbour is
created because of "useful traffic" we skip this routing entry because
rt6_check_neigh cannot pick up a valid neighbour (neigh == NULL) and
thus returns false.

This change was introduced by commit
887c95cc1da53f66a5890fdeab13414613010097 ("ipv6: Complete neighbour
entry removal from dst_entry.")

To quote RFC4191:
"If the host has no information about the router's reachability, then
the host assumes the router is reachable."

and also:
"A host MUST NOT probe a router's reachability in the absence of useful
traffic that the host would have sent to the router if it were reachable."

So, just assume the router is reachable and let's rt6_probe do the
rest. We don't need to create a neighbour on route insertion time.

If we don't compile with CONFIG_IPV6_ROUTER_PREF (RFC4191 support)
a neighbour is only valid if its nud_state is NUD_VALID. I did not find
any references that we should probe the router on route insertion time
via the other RFCs. So skip this route in that case.

v2:
a) use IS_ENABLED instead of #ifdefs (thanks to Sergei Shtylyov)
