Subject: [PATCH 0711/5965] libata: make it clear that sata_inic162x is
 experimental

commit bb9696192826a7d9279caf872e95b41bc26c7eff upstream.

sata_inic162x never reached a state where it's reliable enough for
production use and data corruption is a relatively common occurrence.
Make the driver generate warning about the issues and mark the Kconfig
option as experimental.

If the situation doesn't improve, we'd be better off making it depend
on CONFIG_BROKEN.  Let's wait for several cycles and see if the kernel
message draws any attention.
