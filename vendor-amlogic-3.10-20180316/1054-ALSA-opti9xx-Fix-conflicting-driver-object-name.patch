Subject: [PATCH 1054/5965] ALSA: opti9xx: Fix conflicting driver object name

commit fb615499f0ad28ed74201c1cdfddf9e64e205424 upstream.

The recent commit to delay the release of kobject triggered NULL
dereferences of opti9xx drivers.  The cause is that all
snd-opti92x-ad1848, snd-opti92x-cs4231 and snd-opti93x drivers
register the PnP card driver with the very same name, and also
snd-opti92x-ad1848 and -cs4231 drivers register the ISA driver with
the same name, too.  When these drivers are built in, quick
"register-release-and-re-register" actions occur, and this results in
Oops because of the same name is assigned to the kobject.

The fix is simply to assign individual names.  As a bonus, by using
KBUILD_MODNAME, the patch reduces more lines than it adds.

The fix is based on the suggestion by Russell King.
