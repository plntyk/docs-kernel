Subject: [PATCH 1334/5965] dm mpath: disable WRITE SAME if it fails

commit f84cb8a46a771f36a04a02c61ea635c968ed5f6a upstream.

Workaround the SCSI layer's problematic WRITE SAME heuristics by
disabling WRITE SAME in the DM multipath device's queue_limits if an
underlying device disabled it.

The WRITE SAME heuristics, with both the original commit 5db44863b6eb
("[SCSI] sd: Implement support for WRITE SAME") and the updated commit
66c28f971 ("[SCSI] sd: Update WRITE SAME heuristics"), default to enabling
WRITE SAME(10) even without successfully determining it is supported.
After the first failed WRITE SAME the SCSI layer will disable WRITE SAME
for the device (by setting sdkp->device->no_write_same which results in
'max_write_same_sectors' in device's queue_limits to be set to 0).

When a device is stacked ontop of such a SCSI device any changes to that
SCSI device's queue_limits do not automatically propagate up the stack.
As such, a DM multipath device will not have its WRITE SAME support
disabled.  This causes the block layer to continue to issue WRITE SAME
requests to the mpath device which causes paths to fail and (if mpath IO
isn't configured to queue when no paths are available) it will result in
actual IO errors to the upper layers.

This fix doesn't help configurations that have additional devices
stacked ontop of the mpath device (e.g. LVM created linear DM devices
ontop).  A proper fix that restacks all the queue_limits from the bottom
of the device stack up will need to be explored if SCSI will continue to
use this model of optimistically allowing op codes and then disabling
them after they fail for the first time.

After this patch:

EXT4-fs (dm-6): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
device-mapper: multipath: XXX snitm debugging: got -EREMOTEIO (-121)
device-mapper: multipath: XXX snitm debugging: WRITE SAME I/O failed with error=-121
end_request: critical target error, dev dm-6, sector 528
dm-6: WRITE SAME failed. Manually zeroing.

# cat /sys/block/sdh/queue/write_same_max_bytes
0
# cat /sys/block/dm-6/queue/write_same_max_bytes
0

It should be noted that WRITE SAME support wasn't enabled in DM
multipath until v3.10.
