Subject: [PATCH 1475/5965] parisc: fix interruption handler to respect
 pagefault_disable()

commit 59b33f148cc08fb33cbe823fca1e34f7f023765e upstream.

Running an "echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger" crashes the parisc kernel.  The
problem is, that in print_worker_info() we try to read the workqueue info via
the probe_kernel_read() functions which use pagefault_disable() to avoid
crashes like this:
    probe_kernel_read(&pwq, &worker->current_pwq, sizeof(pwq));
    probe_kernel_read(&wq, &pwq->wq, sizeof(wq));
    probe_kernel_read(name, wq->name, sizeof(name) - 1);

The problem here is, that the first probe_kernel_read(&pwq) might return zero
in pwq and as such the following probe_kernel_reads() try to access contents of
the page zero which is read protected and generate a kernel segfault.

With this patch we fix the interruption handler to call parisc_terminate()
directly only if pagefault_disable() was not called (in which case
preempt_count()==0).  Otherwise we hand over to the pagefault handler which
will try to look up the faulting address in the fixup tables.
