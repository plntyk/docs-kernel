Subject: [PATCH 1690/5965] ALSA: us122l: Fix pcm_usb_stream mmapping
 regression

commit ac536a848a1643e4b87e8fbd376a63091afc2ccc upstream.

The pcm_usb_stream plugin requires the mremap explicitly for the read
buffer, as it expands itself once after reading the required size.
But the commit [314e51b9: mm: kill vma flag VM_RESERVED and
mm->reserved_vm counter] converted blindly to a combination of
VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP like other normal drivers, and this
resulted in the failure of mremap().

For fixing this regression, we need to remove VM_DONTEXPAND for the
read-buffer mmap.
