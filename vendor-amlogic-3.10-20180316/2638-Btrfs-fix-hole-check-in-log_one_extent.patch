Subject: [PATCH 2638/5965] Btrfs: fix hole check in log_one_extent

commit ed9e8af88e2551aaa6bf51d8063a2493e2d71597 upstream.

I added an assert to make sure we were looking up aligned offsets for csums and
I tripped it when running xfstests.  This is because log_one_extent was checking
if block_start == 0 for a hole instead of EXTENT_MAP_HOLE.  This worked out fine
in practice it seems, but it adds a lot of extra work that is uneeded.  With
this fix I'm no longer tripping my assert.  Thanks,
