Subject: [PATCH 2829/5965] rbd: complete notifies before cleaning up
 osd_client and rbd_dev

commit 9abc59908e0c5f983aaa91150da32d5b62cf60b7 upstream.

To ensure rbd_dev is not used after it's released, flush all pending
notify callbacks before calling rbd_dev_image_release(). No new
notifies can be added to the queue at this point because the watch has
already be unregistered with the osd_client.
