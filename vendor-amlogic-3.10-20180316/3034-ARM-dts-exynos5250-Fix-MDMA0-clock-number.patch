Subject: [PATCH 3034/5965] ARM: dts: exynos5250: Fix MDMA0 clock number

commit 8777539479abd7b3efeb691685415dc2b057d0e0 upstream.

Due to incorrect clock specified in MDMA0 node, using MDMA0 controller
could cause system failures, due to wrong clock being controlled. This
patch fixes this by specifying correct clock.
