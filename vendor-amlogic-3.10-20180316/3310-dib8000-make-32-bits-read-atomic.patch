Subject: [PATCH 3310/5965] dib8000: make 32 bits read atomic

commit 5ac64ba12aca3bef18e61c866583155a3bbf81c4 upstream.

As the dvb-frontend kthread can be called anytime, it can race
with some get status ioctl. So, it seems better to avoid one to
race with the other while reading a 32 bits register.
I can't see any other reason for having a mutex there at I2C, except
to provide such kind of protection, as the I2C core already has a
mutex to protect I2C transfers.

Note: instead of this approach, it could eventually remove the dib8000
specific mutex for it, and either group the 4 ops into one xfer or
to manually control the I2C mutex. The main advantage of the current
approach is that the changes are smaller and more puntual.
