Subject: [PATCH 3680/5965] quota: Fix race between dqput() and
 dquot_scan_active()

commit 1362f4ea20fa63688ba6026e586d9746ff13a846 upstream.

Currently last dqput() can race with dquot_scan_active() causing it to
call callback for an already deactivated dquot. The race is as follows:

CPU1					CPU2
  dqput()
    spin_lock(&dq_list_lock);
    if (atomic_read(&dquot->dq_count) > 1) {
     - not taken
    if (test_bit(DQ_ACTIVE_B, &dquot->dq_flags)) {
      spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
      ->release_dquot(dquot);
        if (atomic_read(&dquot->dq_count) > 1)
         - not taken
					  dquot_scan_active()
					    spin_lock(&dq_list_lock);
					    if (!test_bit(DQ_ACTIVE_B, &dquot->dq_flags))
					     - not taken
					    atomic_inc(&dquot->dq_count);
					    spin_unlock(&dq_list_lock);
        - proceeds to release dquot
					    ret = fn(dquot, priv);
					     - called for inactive dquot

Fix the problem by making sure possible ->release_dquot() is finished by
the time we call the callback and new calls to it will notice reference
dquot_scan_active() has taken and bail out.
